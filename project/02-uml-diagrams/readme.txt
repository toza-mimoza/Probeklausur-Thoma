 The mdzip file is not complete. It lacks the multiplicity for every association between the Customer/Admin/Payment service ---> Use case. 
 I also renamed some known Use Cases like: Membership ---> Subscription, but it is still compatible with the Requirements Matrix. 
 I also don't know where to put the Maintanence Use Case, since it is not directly tied to the E-Scooter App (see package name on the diagram). 
 When we have all Use Cases defined, I'll write Use Case Cards. 
 Happy New Year, folks!
